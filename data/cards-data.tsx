            Currently, I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. I began my studies here in September 2022 and am on track to graduate in 2026. UVic's co-op program has provided me with hands-on industry experience, allowing me to apply classroom knowledge to real-world projects. My time at UVic has been both challenging and rewarding, as I continue to deepen my skills and prepare for a career in technology.

            Before attending UVic, I completed my schooling at Pakistan International School in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where I studied from grade 6 through high school. During this time, I undertook both O-level and A-level studies under the Cambridge curriculum. This rigorous program, equivalent if not harder compare to the International Baccalaureate in Canada, provided a strong academic foundation and fostered a high level of discipline. I graduated in June 2022, equipped with the skills and resilience needed to succeed in university and beyond.
